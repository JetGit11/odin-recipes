        Kinilaw is considered an appetizer much like Latin America’s ceviche or seviche (you can think of it as the Filipino version of ceviche). In fact, there are a lot of ceviche variants from all over the world but this version from the Philippines is something that you must try.
Though most would think of this dish as an appetizer, for Filipinos it is more commonly used as a side dish during beer-drinking sessions, referred to as “pulutan“. Its preparation is different too! After all, if most ceviche recipes are normally soaked in citrus juices, kinilaw is rather soaked in vinegar.
